# Ophis Assembler Syntax Highlighter for [Brackets](http://brackets.io)

Syntax highlighter for the Ophis 6502 Assembler by Michael Martin, made specifically for the Brackets IDE.
[Brackets](http://brackets.io) is a modern open-source code editor that's built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

***

### Install
The extension can be installed by simply dragging the .zip file onto the extension manager.

### Notes
If Ophis 6502 is not set automatically as default language for .oph files, click on the current language at bottom right of Brackets window and select Ophis 6502 Assembler in the dropdown menu.

### Issues
Currently the syntax highlighter is not working properly.
Once I get it to work, I will update this repository.
